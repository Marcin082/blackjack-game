## Game Rules
* The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
* Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
* Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
* To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
* If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.
